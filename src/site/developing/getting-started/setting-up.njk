## Development environment

If you don't already have a code editor and are new to git, a good starting point is to:

1. [Setup a GitHub.com account](https://github.com/join)
1. Install the [GitHub Desktop git client](https://desktop.github.com/)
1. For editing code, [install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads)

## Development tools

First, see if you have the needed tools installed.

1. Open a command line/terminal
1. Enter `node -v`
1. Enter `gulp -v`
1. Enter `yarn -v`

If any of those steps return an error you need to install the corresponding
software.

- To install Node: go to the official [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- To install Gulp: Gulp requires Node and can be installed by: `yarn global add gulpjs/gulp-cli`
- To install Yarn: Yarn require Node, [follow the install guide](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Developing the VF Core

You only need to clone [`vf-core`](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core) if you wish to make a pull request to create, amend or delete core components, or modify the way Sass, JS or other assets are compiled.

Here's how:

1. Clone `vf-core`
    - `git clone https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core.git`
1. Move to the directory
    - `cd vf-core`
1. You probably want the develop branch (or [your new feature branch]({{ '/developing/getting-started/naming' | url }}))
    - `git checkout develop`
1. Install [fractal](https://github.com/frctl/fractal) You might need to use `sudo`.
    - `yarn global add @frctl/fractal`
1. Download all the things
    - `yarn install`
1. Run a dev build and open in your browser
    - `gulp vf-dev`

### Developing on Windows?

The Visual Framework is primairly developed on Mac and Linux environments, but it is
also intended to be Windows compatible.

We test and support Windows 10 using [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh/).
