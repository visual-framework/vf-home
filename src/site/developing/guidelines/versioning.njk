## How we version vf-core and its components

The versioning of components is self-contained and distinct from the version number of `vf-core`

Example: if `vf-component`@`2.2.0` has a breaking change, it would be updated to
`vf-component`@`3.0.0`. That new version number does not affect compatibility with with `vf-core`@`2.x`.

All components are compatible with with `vf-core` version 2, some components may require a minimum version of `vf-core`.

## Version numbers explained

We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and do release by tags. 

| Major release | Minor release | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| (Branch)      | (Tag)         | |
| 2.0           | v2.0.0        | Initial release evolving from Compliance theme |
| "             | v2.0.1        | Tagged patch release |
| "             | v2.0.2        | Tagged patch release |
| "             | v2.0.3        | Tagged patch release |
| 2.1           | v2.1.0        | Minor release with possible breaking changes |
| "             | v2.1.1        | Tagged patch release |
| 2.2           | v2.2.0        | Minor release with possible breaking changes |
| 3.0           | v3.0.0        | Major release with many breaking changes|

New features will only be added to the current and development versions.

### Tags for components

Components contain their own README.md and CHANGELOG.md and release are pushed to npm. Therefore we don't publish each individual component release as a unique tag. 

### Release notes?

Release notes can be found on [the GitHub releases tab](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/releases).

### Where's version 1?

Where's version 1.x, you ask? That's the [EMBL-EBI specific Visual Framework](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework) from where this concept [originated, and evolved](https://blogs.embl.org/communications/2018/09/12/faster-scientific-websites-through-reusability/).

### Test releases

Testing releases will be identified in their tag, a la: `v2.0-alpha.1`, where `-alpha.1` is the tag. `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-rc` are tag suffixes.
