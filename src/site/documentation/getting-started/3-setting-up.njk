To develop the Visual Framework your will need some software.

## Development environment

If you don't already have a code editor and are new to git, a good starting point is to:

1. [Setup a GitHub.com account](https://github.com/join)
1. Install the [GitHub Desktop git client](https://desktop.github.com/)
1. For editing code, [install Atom](https://atom.io/)

## Development tools

First, see if you have the needed tools installed.

1. Open a command line/terminal
1. Enter `node -v`
1. Enter `gulp -v`
1. Enter `yarn -v`

If any of those steps return an error you need to install the corresponding
software.

- To install Node: go to the official [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- To install Gulp: Gulp requires Node and can be installed by: `yarn global add gulpjs/gulp-cli`
- To install Yarn: Yarn require Node, [follow the install guide](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Installing the Visual Framework

You only need to clone this repo if you wish to make a pull request to create, amend or delete components of the `vf-core`.

Here's how:

1. Clone this repo
    - `git clone https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-ebi.git`
1. Move to the directory
    - `cd visual-framework-tooling-prototype`
1. You probably want the develop branch (or [your new feature branch](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md))
    - `git checkout develop`
1. Install [fractal](https://github.com/frctl/fractal) You might need to use `sudo`.
    - `yarn global add @frctl/fractal`
1. Download all the things
    - `yarn install`
1. Run a dev build and open in your browser
    - `gulp vf-dev`
