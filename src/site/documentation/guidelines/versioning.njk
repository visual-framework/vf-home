## How we version vf-core and its components

The versioning of components is self-contained and distinct from the version number of `vf-core`

Example: if `vf-component`@`2.2.0` has a breaking change, it would be updated to
`vf-component`@`3.0.0`. That new version number does not affect compatibility with with `vf-core`@`2.x`.

### Versioning explained

As not all users of the Visual Framework will be able to update to the very latest and we do not wish to hold others back, we are using a [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) style of releases.

| Major release | Minor release | Note |
| ------------- | ------------- | ---- |
| (Branch)      | (Tag)         | |
| 2.0           | v2.0.0        | Initial release evolving from Compliance theme |
| "             | v2.0.1        | Tagged patch release |
| "             | v2.0.2        | Tagged patch release |
| "             | v2.0.3        | Tagged patch release |
| 2.1           | v2.1.0        | Minor release with possible breaking changes |
| "             | v2.1.1        | Tagged patch release |
| 2.2           | v2.2.0        | Minor release with possible breaking changes |
| 3.0           | v3.0.0        | Major release with many breaking changes|

We support the last two minor releases with bug fixes and branding. New features will only be added to the current and development versions.

Where's version 1.x, you ask? That's the [EMBL-EBI specific Visual Framework](https://github.com/ebiwd/EBI-Framework) from where this concept [originated, and evolved](https://blogs.embl.org/communications/2018/09/12/faster-scientific-websites-through-reusability/).

### Test releases

Testing releases will be identified in their tag, a la: `v2.0-alpha.1`, where `-alpha.1` is the tag. `-alpha`, `-beta` and `-rc` are tag suffixes.
