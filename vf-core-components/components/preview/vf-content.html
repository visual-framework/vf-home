  <h3>What is EMBL?</h3>
  <p>EMBL is Europe’s flagship laboratory for the life sciences. We are an intergovernmental organisation established in 1974 and are supported by over 20 member states.</p>
  <p>EMBL performs fundamental research in molecular biology, studying the story of life. We offer services to the scientific community; train the next generation of scientists and strive to integrate the life sciences across Europe.</p>
  <p>We are international, innovative and interdisciplinary. We are more than 1600 people, from over 80 countries, operating across six sites in Barcelona (Spain), Cambridge (UK), Grenoble (France), Hamburg (Germany), Heidelberg (Germany), and Rome (Italy). Our scientists work in independent groups and conduct research and offer services in all areas of molecular biology.</p>
  <p>Our research drives the development of new technology and methods in the life sciences. We work to transfer this knowledge for the benefit of society.</p>

  <h2>Section 2: EMBL’s goals</h2>

  <h3>Goal 1: Advancing society</h3>
  <p>The fundamental knowledge that we create, enable and share is immensely valuable to society. Life-science research and services help to address society’s grand challenges, from human health, agriculture, to the environment and beyond.</p>

  <h4>Communications goals:</h4>
  <p>Show the impact of our work in tackling society’s big challenges</p>

  <h3>Goal 2: Enable excellent science to advance our understanding of life</h3>
  <p>We support scientists worldwide with infrastructure, services, technologies, training and platforms for exchange to carry out the best possible research. We are driven by curiosity about life, the most exciting story in the universe. We believe that advancing humankind’s understanding of life is a noble goal in itself.</p>

  <h4>Communications goals:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Develop and sustain support for EMBL from important stakeholders</li>
    <li>Attract the best scientists, engineers, technicians and support staff</li>
